# GameJam1

First weekly Game Jam by the team <Teamname>

#Idea

<Gamename> is an infinite platform shooting game in which the player has to battle against
its problems and concerns. Being defeated by the enemy means that you're going to be affected by the
enemy's effect the next turn, and the only way to escape it is either if you win infinitelly, or if you quit
the game. How many turns can you resist without being defeated by your concerns?

 Aim with the mouse. The bullet will travel to the direction your mouse was at the moment you shot.
